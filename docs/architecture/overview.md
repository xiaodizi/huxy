# Architecture Overview

Muxy is a SwiftUI macOS app that uses [libghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) for terminal emulation and a local-network WebSocket API for companion clients.

## Top-level hierarchy

```
Project → Worktree → SplitNode (splits/tab areas) → TerminalTab → Pane
```

Workspace state is keyed by `WorktreeKey(projectID, worktreeID)` in `AppState`, so every per-project map is per-worktree. `AppState.activeWorktreeID[projectID]` tracks the visible worktree per project. Each project has at least one **primary** worktree pointing at `Project.path`; git projects can attach more.
