# Editor Geometry & Scrolling

The built-in editor is virtualized: only the visible window of lines (± a 500-line buffer) is loaded into the underlying `NSTextView`. Every line outside the rendered window is still tracked by the geometry layer, so the scrollbar, gotoline, and current-line highlight all read from a single source of truth — modelled on CodeMirror 6's HeightMap + scroll-anchor reflow.

## Line number gutter

`CodeEditorView` returns an `EditorScrollContainer` (NSView), which lays out a `LineNumberGutterView` on the left and the editor's `NSScrollView` on the right. Because the gutter is a *sibling* of the scroll view rather than a subview of it, it is naturally pinned during horizontal scrolls — the user's horizontal motion only moves text inside the scroll view. Vertical sync is driven by the existing `boundsDidChangeNotification` from `scrollView.contentView`: `LineNumberGutterExtension` observes that notification and marks the gutter for redraw. The gutter's `draw(_:)` reads `scrollView.contentView.bounds.origin.y` and projects each logical line's document Y (from `viewport.heightMap.heightAbove(line:)` / `heightOfLine(_:)`) into its own coordinate space, so labels stay aligned with both wrapped and unwrapped layouts and remain correct as estimates are refined into measurements.

## Reflow loop on jump / measurement

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant J as scrollToGlobalLine
  participant A as ScrollAnchor
  participant M as HeightMap
  participant R as refreshViewport
  participant SV as NSScrollView

  U->>J: jump to line N
  J->>A: setScrollAnchor(line=N, delta=-h/3)
  A->>M: heightAbove(N) [estimate]
  J->>SV: setBoundsOrigin(estimatedY)

  loop ≤5 iterations until pixel stable
    J->>R: refreshViewport(force: true)
    R->>R: render new window text
    R->>M: applyMeasurements(measured heights)
    Note over M: gap decomposes into<br/>measured + residual gap
    R->>A: anchor.pixelY(in: M)
    R->>SV: writeAnchorToScrollView()<br/>(skipped if delta < 0.5px)
  end

  J->>SV: cursor placed on line N
```

`HeightMap` only has *estimated* heights for lines outside the window. Wrapped estimates are still line-addressable: every estimated logical line has its own height and prefix coordinate derived from that line's character count. The first scroll lands at a deterministic line position; rendering measures the new window; the heightmap refines those line heights; the user's logical anchor gets a new pixel position. The reflow loop bumps scroll silently until the geometry settles.

## Write paths

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Programmatic
    Jump2[scrollToGlobalLine]
    SearchJ[SearchController.scrollToMatch]
    Reflow[refreshViewport reflow]
  end
  subgraph User
    Mouse[Trackpad / scrollbar]
  end

  Jump2 --> SetA[setScrollAnchor]
  SearchJ --> SetA
  Reflow --> WAS[writeAnchorToScrollView]
  SetA --> WAS
  WAS -->|isWritingScrollProgrammatically=true| SVO[NSScrollView.contentView<br/>setBoundsOrigin]
  Mouse --> Notif[boundsDidChangeNotification]
  Notif --> Recon[reconcileScrollBoundsChange]
  Recon -->|guard isWritingScrollProgrammatically| DAS[deriveAnchorFromScrollView]
  DAS --> AnchorBox[(ScrollAnchor)]
  WAS -.-> Notif
```

`writeAnchorToScrollView`:
1. Reads the current pixel scroll Y from the anchor.
2. Clamps to `[0, totalDocumentHeight - visibleHeight]`.
3. Sets `isWritingScrollProgrammatically = true` so the user-scroll observer doesn't re-derive the anchor from our own write.
4. Writes `setBoundsOrigin` and clears the flag.

## HeightMap block lifecycle

`HeightMap` keeps the document as a sequence of `Block`s, each either `.measured(lineHeights:)` (exact pixel heights from `layoutManager.boundingRect`) or `.estimated(perLineCharCounts:)` (per-line oracle estimates with a height prefix table).

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  G0["estimated [0..N]<br/>file open"] --> M1["measured [0..K]<br/>after first refresh"]
  M1 --> Mid["estimated [K..N]"]
  Mid --> Jump["jump to J:<br/>+measured [J-W..J+W]"]
  Jump --> Edit["edit at L:<br/>splits, re-estimates inserted run"]
```

Edits pass through `replaceLines`, which updates the underlying block sequence and re-estimates inserted lines. Consecutive `.estimated` blocks are merged without losing per-line prefixes.

## Why this works

- **Estimates are per logical line.** A long minified line gets a tall estimate before measurement; a short comment line gets a short one. `heightAbove(line)` and `lineAtY(y)` remain inverse operations for unmeasured wrapped content.
- **Scroll position is not pixel-anchored.** When measurements refine geometry, the anchor's pixel position changes — the reflow loop re-pins it before the user notices.
- **Wrap changes preserve logical anchors.** Toggling wrap or changing the editor width derives the current `ScrollAnchor` before geometry is rebuilt, then re-pins that anchor after TextKit and `HeightMap` are reconfigured.
- **Single source of truth.** Scroll math, jump math, search-jump, and current-line-highlight all derive Y values from the same `HeightMap`.
- **Measurement is pixel-exact.** `recordMeasuredLineHeights` feeds `layoutManager.boundingRect` heights (excluding trailing newline) directly.
