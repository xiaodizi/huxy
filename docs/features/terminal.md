# Terminal

Muxy's terminals are powered by [libghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty), running on a Metal layer for fast, GPU-accelerated rendering.

## Configuration

Ghostty is configured at `~/.config/ghostty/config`. Open it with **Muxy → Open Configuration…**, reload after editing with `⌘⇧R`.

Most Ghostty options work — fonts, colors, padding, keybinds, shell integration. Muxy applies the active light/dark variant automatically when the system appearance changes.

## Find in terminal

`⌘F` opens an inline search overlay scoped to the focused pane. Enter / Shift-Enter cycle through matches; Escape dismisses.

## Find in files

`Cmd+Shift+F` searches text across the active project. It uses `rg`, supports match case and whole word, and opens the selected match in the editor.

## Copy and paste

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Copy (with selection) | `⌘C` |
| Send `^C` to program | `⌘C` with no selection |
| Paste | `⌘V` or right-click → Paste |
| X11 selection paste | Middle-click |

Enable **Settings -> General -> Auto-copy terminal selection** to copy selected terminal text on mouse release.

## Working directory

Muxy tracks the cwd via Ghostty's shell integration (OSC 7). The directory is persisted in workspace snapshots so newly recreated tabs land in the same folder when applicable.

## Muxy CLI

Use the `muxy` command to open projects and control panes from a shell or automation script. See [Muxy CLI](muxy-cli.md).

## Custom command shortcuts

Define reusable shell command shortcuts in **Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts → Custom Commands**:

- Display name, command, optional icon, optional keybinding.
- Triggering one creates a new tab and runs the command.
- Useful for `npm run dev`, `make watch`, `just test`, …

## Rich Input

`Cmd+I` opens a multiline composer for prompts, files, images, and broadcast sends. See [Rich Input](rich-input.md).

## Right-click menu

Inside a terminal pane: **Paste**, **Split Right**, **Split Down**, **Close Pane**.

## Notifications from the terminal

OSC 9 and OSC 777 notification escape sequences are routed into Muxy's notification panel and (optionally) macOS notifications. See [Notifications](notifications.md).

## Quick-select labels

Ghostty's quick-select feature lets you focus a pane or surface by typing a label key. Labels and bindings are configured in the Ghostty config.
